# TSP-GeneticAlgorithm

## What It Does
- This program will ask the user to input several parameters for use in the genetic algorithm and find the most efficient path to travel to each point exactly once, and finally back to the original point.
- Points (Cities) are randomized.
- The shortest path taken by each generation will be printed, and after completion, the generation which took the most efficient path will be shown as well as the order which one should travel to take this path.

# Future Improvements
- - To have the user be able to specify where each city is (on a grid) instead of randomizing all points.
  - This would give the program real world usability.
